Prototype-of-Food-Ordering-Services
===================================

Final Graduate Project August 2013

This is an individual project. I built not only consumer end-user (Android application), vendor end-user (PHP website) but also web server (PHP, MySQL, and Apache).

This is a fully working prototype, in order to use it, a web server must be hosted. Then, several adjustment about the target host settings and address, and we are good to go.
